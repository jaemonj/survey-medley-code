name: Assess how within-subject brain-behavior slopes differ between questionnaires
stage: "group"
description: >
    Run an F-test on the within-subject slopes between brain activation and behavioral response for each questionnaire, 
    to see whether any within-questionnaire slopes are statistically different from each other.

hypothesis: "Some within-questionnaire slopes statistically differ from each other in some parts of the brain."
conclusion: >
    Still under discussion, but the F-test yielded some significant regions, 
    some of which overlapped with the regions found in the within-subject brain-behavior analysis with all questions.
