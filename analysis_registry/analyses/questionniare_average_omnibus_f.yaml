stage: "group"
description: >
  We use randomise to run an omnibus f-test to test whether any pair of questionaire average activations
  differ from each other.  The permutation scheme adjusts for the correlations between measures within-subject in
  the group model (model mean adjusts by subject as well).  Individual paired t-tests for all 10 pairs of 
  questionnaires are also run in an effort to help understand the f-test results.

hypothesis: "Some questionnaire-based average activation estimates will differ from others."
conclusion: "There is a strong result for the omnibus f-test, but Patrick needs to review the individual paired comparisons."
notes: >
  The paired comparisons can be used to conclude where differences 
  DO occur, but a lack of a significant paired t-test
  cannot be used to conclude two questionnaires are the same.  Keep in mind that questionnaires with fewer
  questions have less power in these comparisons.
