stage: "time series"
description: >
  This analysis runs time series models for all subjects to estimate question-specific
  estimates as well as questionnaire-specific estimates. For the questionnaire averages, all question
  estimates were included, regardless of whether the subject responded or had an acceptable key press.  
  Contrast estimates filenames include "err" if they did not respond or used an unacceptable key
  for that question.

hypothesis: "No formal hypothesis at this stage; just calculating estimates for group analyses to study questionnaire differences."
conclusion: "The outlier assessment worked well and we have at least 93 good data sets for each question/questionnaire."
notes: >
  There are lists in text files indicating the good subjects for each contrast (based on the outlier assessment) 
  located in the outlier_assessment subdirectory within the output directory.
