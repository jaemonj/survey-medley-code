description: >
  Using the 10 pairwise difference activation maps, run PCA to see whether 
  there spatial patterns in which the contrasts differ, summarizing how groups 
  of voxels vary together across all pairwise comparisons.

conclusion: >
  There are 4 nice looking components, but Jeanette cannot discern 
  whether the results are psychologically interesting.
notes: >
  Jeanette has written a guide/explainer at the top of the results_file entry to aid in 
  understanding and interpreting the PCA results.
