  This is a collection of quick analyses to gain insight into what the behavioral data look like. 
  For example, who is missing data, who is missing responses to questions, RTs, RTs and word count relationship.

hypothesis: "Who has high motion, Question responses vary by question/subject, RTs vary by question word count "
conclusion: >
  RTs seem to relate to the number of words in the question, impulsive venture questions 
  have highest missingness as does Q32 from UPPS.
notes: >
  In analyses where we do not exclude the activation estimates when responses are missing, we should recall the high amount of 
  missing values in all three impulsive venture questions compared to other questionnaires.
